    "comment": "My vote against this proposal stems from the belief that it is premature. While I agree that there's a clear need to enhance reward conditions for SPOs and increase delegation rewards, the current lack of clarity around the treasury's future investment strategy and fund allocation prevents a well-informed decision on halving treasury deposits. Before proceeding, I would at least want to observe initial budget approvals, which ideally would include discussions on treasury investment strategies. Once we have a better grasp of the treasury's long-term sustainability, revisiting this proposal will be a priority for me, as it touches on a fundamental aspect of decentralization. I also want to reassure anyone reading this that I will keep this proposal in mind when evaluating upcoming budget proposals since keeping the government lean by cutting and redistributing taxes is generally something I support. Despite my 'no' vote, I appreciate the proposers for highlighting this crucial matter."
