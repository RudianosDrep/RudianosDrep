    "comment": "I am voting in favor of approving this proposal. At first glance the budget seems high, but it is significantly lower than the initial proposal, which was made during the intersect proposal process. Additionally, there are good explanations with this proposal on why the funds requested are required, and this comes from a significant amount of community interaction, which answers most open questions not answered by the first proposal. For anyone interested, check the full long-form proposal, as it has many additional details that helped me make an informed decision. The most important consideration for me, however, is simply one of protecting the integrity of the Cardano voting system. There are no monetary incentives at this stage for anyone to build governance tools. Therefore, having a treasury funded, community based, open source system is very important. It may be that as time goes on this need will no longer be there, but for now this is the prudent option, and I believe it is well worth the costs outlined."
