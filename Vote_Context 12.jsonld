This vote is therefore primarily to confirm that I still support the project, as detailed in the info action, and approve of the outlined mechanism to distribute the treasury funds. Since this is the first treasury withdrawal request in the Voltaire era, the process is unchartered territory. However the process here looks good, and I can think of no better set of builders on Cardano to make this a success. I thank them for their work."
