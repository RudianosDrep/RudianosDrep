There is no limitation on the amount of budgets that can be approved and since this budget is simply looking to fund projects that have high community support and are already part of the intersect budget proposal there is no added cost to the ecosystem. I see this proposed budget mostly as a failsafe to approve high support proposals in the event that intersect fails to get an approved budget or bundles spending proposals in a way that the community does not support. In the event of that happening this is a good backup option."
