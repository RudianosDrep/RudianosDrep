    "comment": "I have decided to vote against the proposed treasury spending limit of 350 million ADA, as I believe this amount exceeds what is necessary. While I recognize that this figure serves as an upper spending limit, I also know that reducing such limits will become increasingly challenging over time, especially as various priorities become reliant on treasury funds. Furthermore, I plan to support the first, lower spending limit proposal currently under consideration. However, I understand that there is a possibility this proposal may not pass or could be deemed unconstitutional. If the first proposal is not ratified, I will change my vote to support this proposal. It remains critical to avoid a situation where no spending limit is approved, as this could result in delays and uncertainty in finalizing the budget."
