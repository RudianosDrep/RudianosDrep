    "comment": "I have decided to vote against this proposal for the simple reason that I believe the funding requirement at this early stage is too high. Since this is the first budget round on Cardano many critical funding requirements are being funded and this will absorb most of the funds that I feel we should realistically be spending in one budget cycle. Additionally there seems to be an error with the proposal metadata and the proposal will likely need to be resubmitted regardless. I would suggest for the team to look at resubmitting this proposal for the Q3 2026 budget."
