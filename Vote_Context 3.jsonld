    "comment": "After reviewing the proposed info action roadmap, I have decided to vote Yes. To me, the most crucial aspect of a document like this is its overall direction. While an info action isn’t strictly enforceable, its general direction carries significant weight from a governance perspective, and I’m pleased with the trajectory this document lays out.\nThe roadmap’s primary focus on core infrastructure is spot-on. To keep Cardano at the forefront of the blockchain space, we must prioritize scalability and interoperability. I’m encouraged to see key infrastructure projects like Leios, Mithril, Hydra, Midgard, and Peras highlighted, alongside a clear direction for other improvements to the chain’s foundation.\nAnother positive is the commitment to updating priorities based on community feedback, which is emphasized right at the start. This roadmap is designed as a short-term guide, and priorities will naturally shift as the community evolves. Acknowledging this shows that the authors understand the importance of adaptability and are dedicated to staying aligned with community needs.\nI’m also happy to see SPO rewards included as a focus area. The community has long recognized the need for updates here, and prioritizing this in the roadmap is a meaningful step forward.\nMy only reservation is that governance isn’t highlighted as a near-term focus. I believe getting governance right is vital for Cardano’s long-term health, and I would have liked to see it addressed more prominently. That said, this omission isn’t enough to sway my vote. The roadmap remains well-oriented and forward-thinking overall."
