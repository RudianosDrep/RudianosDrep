I believe that we need to fund many of the ecosystem priorities that came out of the proposal review phase and this budget will facilitate that. Important caveat here is that I do not support every proposal that was included in this budget and voting in favor of the budget does not mean I will vote in favor of all proposals when it come to approving treasury withdrawl requests. The way intersect structures said requests will be part of that consideration when the time comes."
